Template Method:

It's based on inheritance
Defines skeleton of algorithm which can't be changed by sub classes. Only certain operations can be overridden in sub classes
Parent class completely controls the algorithm and differs only certain steps to concrete classes
Binding is done at compile time

Strategy:

It's based on delegation/composition
It changes guts of the object by modifying method behaviour
It's used to switch between family of algorithms
It changes the behaviour of the object at run time by completely replacing one algorithm with other algorithm at run time
Binding is done at run time
